2. pip install picamera
3. sudo pip install flask
4. git clone https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/flask-video-streaming.git

	The inet addr is your local IP address. In this case, 10.0.1.3.
9. Start the Flask server by running this command:

11.Open up a web browser on your favorite device and go to this address http://10.0.1.3:5000,
	except replace that IP address with the one that your Raspberry Pi is running on.
